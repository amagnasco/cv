Hi! My name is Ale and this CV represents a small portion of my tech experience since the late 20th century.

The compiled PDF is [(Alessandro_Magnasco.pdf)](https://github.com/amagnasco/cv/blob/dd2c81db16bc1369db20c3e29e3d9c6cd2e3b87b/Alessandro_Magnasco.pdf). Download it to see in full resolution.

GitHub might give you some trouble downloading, in which case get it from [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/read/ftmmqcdnrqcn), where you can see the PDF and code side-by-side.
Give it a few seconds to compile, then click download to the right of the green "recompile" button.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions at amagnasco at gradcenter dot cuny dot edu.

Best,
Ale
