Hi! My name is Ale and this CV represents a small portion of my tech experience since the late 20th century.
This needs to be compiled in XeLaTeX to produce a PDF. An online compilation is available at https://www.overleaf.com/read/ftmmqcdnrqcn.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me with any questions at amagnasco at gradcenter dot cuny dot edu.

Best,
Ale
